So for my development process I first started by creating a chatgpt log and pasting in the code you provided in the index.html file. Under the code I wrote down to the best of my ability the exact style of the css in text describing all details. It should be visable in github classroom as one of the first pushes I did. Then I started to do the worst part. Changing all the details to exactly match the screenshot.

I mostly did this by hand adjusting margins, changing colors, adding a few missing elements. The three biggest challenges I faced was color acuracy, I ended up giving up on this one and just eyeballing the colors to the best of my ability. The little dashes under the h2 text and the positioning of the image in the quiz section.

To address these challenges I ended up asking chatgpt for ideas, implementing them and seeing what happened. First chatgpt wanted me to do a flex box but that resorted with the image above the text, the order in the html file, but not what I wanted. Then it suggested I used a grid, which ended up mostly working with a little padding adjustment for the image. For the dashes I was suggested to use a thing called ::after which worked. I think chatgpt was heplful but if I had a more encyclopedic knowledge of css myself I could direct chatgpt a little better in my instructions.
